# Data Analytics
## SQL Sample
### I used mock data in Excel about crowd funding, and I was able to work to some conclusions about crowd funding campaigns. I leveraged conditional formatting, formula calculations, pivot charts, and pivot tables. I calculated means, variances, and standard deviations, in the data analysis and was able to come to some conclusions.

#### Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
 - Most crowdfunding campaigns are successful.
 - Crowdfunding campaigns seeking goals between $15,000 and $35,000 have been funded more than 75% of the time.
 - Crowdfunding campaigns for theater, music, film & video, account for more than 70% of all failed outcomes.
#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
 - More than 1/3 of crowdfunding campaigns have been for the plays subcategory which could skew summaries about the viability of campaigns for other categories and subcategories.
 - The dataset does not have enough entries to statistically account for how the 10 or more columns of varying data relate to outcomes.
#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
 - Graphing country vs. outcome could provide valuable insight into the viability of crowdfunding campaigns originating in different countries.
 - Graphing currency vs. outcome could provide valuable insight into the viability of crowdfunding campaigns based on the chosen base currency solicited.
