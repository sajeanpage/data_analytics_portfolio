# Data Analytics
## Excel
- I used mock data in Excel about crowd funding, and I was able to work to some conclusions about crowd funding campaigns. I leveraged conditional formatting, formula calculations, pivot charts, and pivot tables. I calculated means, variances, and standard deviations in the data analysis and was able to come to some conclusions.
